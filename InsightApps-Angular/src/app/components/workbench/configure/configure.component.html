    We use the GPT API Key to enable the Copilot feature, which assists you in building sheets and charts after
    connecting to your data source. This integration helps streamline your workflow by providing intelligent suggestions
    and automating tasks based on your data.

<p>While the GPT API Key powers our Copilot feature, providing valuable assistance in building
    sheets and charts after connecting to your data source, please be aware that suggestions or
    automated data builds may occasionally fail. This can occur due to various factors, such as the
    complexity of your data or temporary API limitations. We recommend verifying all suggestions and
    manually adjusting where needed to ensure the accuracy and relevance of your outputs.</p>
